# E-commerce platform
## Introduction
This MERN stack e-commerce website is my capstone project and showcases my ability to create a comprehensive and fully functional online shopping platform. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), it offers all the necessary features for a seamless shopping experience. I have implemented the use of Redux for global state management, React Bootstrap for the user interface, JSON Web Tokens for user authentication, and integrated both PayPal and credit card payment options.

## Potential expansion
In terms of potential areas of expansion, this website has the capability to integrate with various other tools and services, such as shipping and tracking systems, customer relationship management tools, and marketing and advertising platforms. Additionally, the implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can further enhance the customer experience by providing personalized recommendations, product searches and improved product display.
